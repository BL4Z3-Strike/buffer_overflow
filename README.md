# Buffer Overflow Laboratory and Exploit

## Overview

This repository contains a laboratory project focused on demonstrating and exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The project includes implementations in both C and Python, showcasing how buffer overflows can be exploited in different programming environments.

## What is Buffer Overflow?

A buffer overflow occurs when data written to a buffer exceeds its allocated size, causing adjacent memory to be overwritten. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or even the execution of arbitrary code. Understanding buffer overflows is crucial for both security professionals and developers to mitigate potential vulnerabilities in software.

## Project Structure

- `c_exploit/`: Contains the C implementation of the vulnerable program and the corresponding exploit code.
- `python_exploit/`: Contains the Python implementation of the exploit that targets the vulnerable program.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of C programming and Python scripting
- Familiarity with buffer overflow concepts

### Running the C Exploit

1. Run the vulnerable program:
   ```bash
   gcc vulnerable_program.c -o vulnerable_program
2. Start the Listener:
   ```bash
   nc -lvnp 4444
3. Exploit Target Program:
   ```bash
   python exploit.py
4. Got the Shell:
   -And now you got hacked the target system using buffer overflow vulnerability.
